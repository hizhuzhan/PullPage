# PullPage
A jQuery plugin for displaying an overlay over a regular page. Lots of options and callbacks.

Great for call to action forms, advertising campaigns, splash pages, etc.

## Option Reference
PullPage can be called with the following options. If you wish to set global options,
you can modify the ```$.fn.pullPage.defaults``` object. Beware though, this overwrites
the plugin's copy of the defaults.

```javascript
$('#myPullPage').pullPage({
  autoShow        : true,                   // Shows pullPage as soon as it's initialized.
  autoHide        : false,                  // Hides pullPage after activated.
  initDelay       : 0,                      // Delay setting for `autoShow`
  hideDelay       : 3000,                   // Delay setting for `autoHide`
  showTransition  : 0,                      // Milliseconds for pullPage fadeIn transition
  hideTransition  : 500,                    // Milliseconds for pullPage fadeOut transition
  showHideLink    : true,                   // Append a link to manually close  pullPage.
  hideLinkText    : 'Hide me!',             // Text to display inside the hide link
  hideLinkClass   : 'pullPage-hide-link',   // Class for hide link
  containerClass  : 'pullPage-container',   // Class for pullPage container.
  hiddenClass     : 'pullPage-hidden',      // This class is should be applied to the container
                                            // for the rest of your site. Cannot be applied to the body.
  hiddenClassEl   : false                   // Specify a $ selector for the element to apply
                                            // the hiddenClass to.
});
```

You'll want to execute this script as soon as possible, because the idea is you want to load this
'page' before anything else.

## Methods
Calling the pullPage constructor returns the following public methods.

```javascript
var myPullPage = $('#myPullPage').pullPage({ autoShow: false });

myPullPage.show();   // Show
myPullPage.hide();   // Hide
```

## CSS
The javascript takes care of most of the styling necessary, but there is a small amount of CSS
 required for the plugin to work nicely. Also, it's a good idea to put these styles close to
 the top of your document, because you want them to render ASAP.

And thats it for now!
